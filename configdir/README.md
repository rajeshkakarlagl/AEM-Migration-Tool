# Groovy AEM Migration Tool

Migration tool for migrating content into AEM from legacy Content Management Systems by generating an AEM Content Package. This migration tool supports nearly any legacy CMS which can produce an XML representation of content. 

## Quickstart

To use the script:

1. Checkout the project
2. Copy the `sample-file-mappings.csv` to `[configdir]/file-mappings.csv` and add any direct file mappings in source,target format
3. Copy the `sample-page-mappings.csv` to `[configdir]/page-mappings.csv` and add any page xml mappings in source,target format
4. Copy the `sample-filter.xml` to `filter.xml` and add the filter paths
5. Copy the `sample-properties.xml` to `[configdir]/properties.xml` and update the package name and group
6. Copy the `sample-replacement-config.json` to `[configdir]/replacement-config.json` and add / update the replacement configuration
7. Copy the `sample-replacements.csv` to `[configdir]/replacements.csv` and add any replacements
5. Copy the content from legacy content export to the `work/source` directory
6. Run the script with `groovy migrate.groovy [configdir] [batch]`

Use:

`groovy migrate.groovy [config] [batch (Optional)]`

The end result will be a Content Package ZIP file in the `work` directory.

## Script Parameters

There are only two parameters which can be provided when executing the script

 - **config** -- This required parameter is the first parameter to the script. It should be a directory containing the configuration files for the migration run. You can create multiple configuration directories to allow you keep a history of previous migration runs.
 - **batch** -- This optional parameter will only process pages with the specified Batch ID from the page-mappings.csv. This will also auto-generate a filter.xml based on these paths. 
 
## Configuration Files

The following files are used to control how the script is executed:

 - **file-mappings.csv** -- contains a list of files which should be copied along with the page content. Can also be used to populate a list of replacements within the migrated text.
 - **page-mappings.csv** -- contains a list of the pages which should be migrated. Additional columns can be added and will be available in the `pageData` parameter in the templates. Key attributes include:
    - **Status** -- must be the first column. Used to exclude pages within the list from being migrated, useful when using a larger content inventory spreadsheet to inform the migration process. The status of `Remove` or `Missing` will skip a page from being migrated.
    - **Batch** -- batches are used to control which pages can be included in a migration with the optional Batch script parameter, they are also useful for tracking when and from where content was migrated.
    - **Template** -- the template to load. The templates are located in the `templates` folder and are loaded by name. So the template "content" would be found at "templates/content.groovy"
    - **Legacy Url** -- the URL for the legacy page, this can be used to generate replacements or to populate a [Redirect Map Manager](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/features/redirect-map-manager/index.html) configuration
    - **Source Path** -- the path to look for the source file under the `work/source` directory. Should start with a slash.
    - **New Path** -- the new AEM repository path for the page. 
    - **New Url** -- the migrated AEM URL. Should end in .html
 - **filter.xml** -- the filter.xml to be used if the batch parameter is not specified
 - **properties.xml** -- used to set the package version, group ID and name
 - **replacement-config.json** -- configures the generation of the replacement map. The minimal example shows replacing the old Paths and URLs with the new URL from the `page-mappings.csv` and `file-mappings.csv`. You can also also use regular expressions to extract the replacements by setting the mode to `regex` and setting the following parameters:
    - **extractionPattern** -- a regular expression to extract the desired value
    - **sourceReplacement** -- the text used for the replacement source, can use parameters from the `extractionPattern`
    - **targetReplacement** -- optional, though if not used a `targetKey` must be specified, the text used for the replacement target, can use parameters from the `extractionPattern`
 - **replacements.csv** -- a list of replacements to perform. Must be referenced in the `replacement-config.json` to use
 
## Templates

Each template is a groovy file with a single function:

    void renderPage(Map pageData, GPathResult inXml, MarkupBuilder outXml, Map replacements)

This function will be called by the migration script with:

 - **pageData** - a Map of data loaded from the row in the `page-mappings.csv`
 - **inXml** - The parsed source XML File
 - **outXml** - The .content.xml file to which to write the migrated content
 - **replacements** - a map of replacement strings
 
Additionally, a .commons.groovy is provided to handle a number of common AEM structures including components, the page metadata and performing replacements. See the `templates/content.groovy` template as an example.  You will need to modify the path to the desired page component for the sling:resourceType when setting the page properties in the groovy template script.
